# PhysicsVR
Course project for KTH DH2323 - Computer Graphics in Interaction
 
This project was inspired by games such as BONEWORKS and Half Life: Alyx, which make use of fully-physical interaction models in a VR environment. In this simple scene, the user is able to push and grab a few objects and fire a simple hitscan gun.

Footage of the project can be seen [here.](https://vimeo.com/431783283)

## Prerequisites

In order to build and run this project, you will need:
* Unity Editor version 2019.2.6f1 64-bit. You may convert the project to work in different versions, but this project was only built and tested using this specific version and therefore is not guaranteed to work with any other versions of the editor.
* Steam and SteamVR. This project uses the SteamVR API for Unity.
* A compatible HMD and controllers. This project has only been tested on the Oculus Rift S with Touch controllers and WMR emulator, but should work with any analogous hardware (Oculus Rift CV1, Oculus Quest, HTC Vive).
